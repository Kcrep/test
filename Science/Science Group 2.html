            <h2>Wind Turbines</h2>
            <p>Wind turbines generate power by rotating propeller-like blades around a central rotor, which drives a generator to produce electricity. This process harnesses the kinetic energy of the wind rather than using electricity to create wind.</p>

            <h2>Solar Panels</h2>
            <p>Solar panels utilize photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity, which can be used for various devices or stored in batteries. This conversion process involves exciting electrons, allowing them to flow through a circuit and generate electricity.</p>
